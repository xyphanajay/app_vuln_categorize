# vuln_app_categ
Scan play store applications for potential security vulnerabilities using AndroBugs. Trained a model to predict other vulnerabilities if one kind vulnerability is present. 

## Steps to use the script
1. Place all the generated reports(generated by AndroBugs) in "report folder" (eg. vuln_app_cate/report/*)
2. Copy the script - "report_mat.py", outside the report folder.
3. Start script - "python report_mat.py" //python3 is required
4. An excel sheet will be generated after complete analysis of all reports outside the report folder.

## Way around - steps
1. $ git clone git@github.com:xyphanajay/vuln_app_categ.git
2. copy all the reports that you want to analyse in ./vuln_app_categ/report
3. $ cd vuln_app_categ
4. $ python report_mat.py
5. Check excel sheet named "Final_report_(time)" in ./vuln_app_categ
